This folder contains the main files regarding remigration process using real data:

The main M-files to be considered are:

 1 - teste_terceiro_campos.m : Remigration is performed using Eq. (1) of the paper
 2 - teste_RMfbrutaFO_campos.m : Remigration is performed using Eq. (7) of the paper

The user must run teste_terceiro_campos.m first of all in order to generate the main results, 
including weighted- and unity-weighted Kirchhoff time-migration, 
as well as the undermigrated input section to be remigrated along the same code. 
After this code has been run, teste_RMfbrutaFO_campos.m can be run, in which only Eq. (7)
will be calculated. In this release, the codes are set to generate the results referring to
2-D line 0258-3001, as discussed in the paper. Files named remigrado_0258_***.dat along with files 
named vel_0258_RMS***.dat can be equally used as input in both codes. Notice, however, that
the input files are the ones that generated the figures seen in the paper for this
specific line.

Bonus M-files include:

 3 - TTI_0258.m : This code computes the interval traveltimes values (TTI) derived from the 
input depth velocity model velocidade_0258_depth.dat. 
 4 - RMS_0258.m : Computes the RMS velocity field used in all remigration codes. This code 
must be run only after TTI_028.m.
 5 demigra_campos.m : This code computes demigrated sections in the time domain. The input
files for this code are named teste*.dat and vel_campos*_RMS.dat. The output sections 
generaed by this code are named as campos*.dat in this repository.
 6 - equaliza_amplitues.m : Equalization of amplitude values are realized by this code.
Normally run after any remigration process descibed in items 1 and 2. The user must specify
any dumb variable to receive the remigration output result before running this code. It
works using any section in time, under the same conditions.
 7 - halfdif2.m : Performs the half-derivative, Eq. (2) of the paper.
 8 - operadores_mig.m and operadores_remig.m : These codes help in calculate one parameter
called dipflag used in some remigration section. It is the equivalent of the time difference
of dip discussed in the paper that constrains migration and remigration stacking operators
in order to avoid or permit the calculation of alias noise.
 9 ormsby.m : A bandpass filter.
 10 - ricker.m : Calculates the Ricker wavelet.

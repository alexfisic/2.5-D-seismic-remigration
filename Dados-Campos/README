This folder contains the main files regarding remigration process using real data:

The main M-files to be considered are:

 1 - teste_terceiro_campos.m : Remigration is performed using Eq. (1) of the paper
 2 - teste_RMfbrutaFO_campos.m : Remigration is performed using Eq. (7) of the paper

The user must run teste_terceiro_campos.m first of all in order to generate the main results, 
including weighted- and unity-weighted Kirchhoff time-migration, 
as well as the undermigrated input section to be remigrated along the same code. 
After this code has been run, teste_RMfbrutaFO_campos.m can be run, in which only Eq. (7)
will be calculated. In this release, the codes are set to generate the results referring to
2-D line 0258-3001, as discussed in the paper. Files named remigrado_0258_***.dat along with files 
named vel_0258_RMS***.dat can be equally used as input in both codes. Notice, however, that
the input files are the ones that generated the figures seen in the paper for this
specific line.

Bonus M-files include:

 3 - TTI_0258.m : This code computes the interval traveltimes values (TTI) derived from the 
input depth velocity model velocidade_0258_depth.dat. 
 4 - RMS_0258.m : Computes the RMS velocity field used in all remigration codes. This code 
must be run only after TTI_028.m.

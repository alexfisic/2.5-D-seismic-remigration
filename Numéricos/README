This folder contains codes for numerical modeling, migration and remigration.

The following M-files are used:

 1 - primeiro.m : 2-D zero-offset/finite-offset modeling, migration and remigration. All parameters 
are user-specified. They may be freely modified. Migration and remigration here are performed in the
depth domain.
 2 - segundo.m : 2-D zero-offset modeling, migration and remigration. Migration and remigration are
performed in the time domain. Lines 42 and 44 of the code determine the velocity field of interest,
which can be constant or with lateral variation. The user must choose one of the options and comment
the other to run the code for each case.
 3 - terceiro.m : 2-D finite-offset modeling, migration and remigration. Migration and remigration are
performed in the time domain. Lines 59 and 61 of the code determine the velocity field of interest,
which can be constant or with lateral variation. The user must choose one of the options and comment
the other to run the code for each case. 
 4 - RMfbrutaZO.m and RMfbrutaFO.m : 2-D zero-offset and finite-offset remigration only of the latter
codes, each one using a numeric version of Eq. (7) (double integral) of the paper.

The other M-files are bonus.
